Attention: Not for business, that is personal used and for study.

That is a easy program that use a lot of function of str.find() to parse the text and catch needs.

Because i don't know some reptile framwork to do this fairly well. So i just use some function brute-force.

Welcome some body push some pull-requests to help me optimize it and let me learn more.

Thanks.

Run it: python3 reptile.py (In you relative path)


If program break case some unknow error, you can rerun it use: python3 reptile.py last_type last_novel_num

Example: python3 reptile.py jingdian 77

That will let program start in type of jingdian and novel num of 78(not 77, 77 will be skip because 77 has error.)

If not send that extra parameter the program will run in front.
